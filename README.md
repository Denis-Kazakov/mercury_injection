# Mercury injection capillary pressure experiment

## Multioutput regression with the number of target variables much larger than the number of features 

A study project to predict mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) curve. The data set included a small number of features – well data, geology and lithology – and 200 target variables to be predicted, with a total of 455 data points.

For details, please see the notebooks:

00_EDA - exploratory data analysis
01_regression - solution of the problem as stated
02_volume_vs_pressure - an alternative solution: volume vs pressure, assuming pressure values are independent variables
